# Learn Ruby: a resource list

Hi! As a second-career developer who didn't go through a bootcamp, I've found it helpful to keep a road map of learning resourcesâ€”building my own curriculum, in a way. I hope this list helps you too!

If you notice any broken links here, please let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-ruby/issues/new).

## Table of contents

The "not done" sections (currently "Fundamental tools" and below) are somewhat chaotic because I haven't yet seen what's worth keeping there.

## Preliminaries

- **If you want to keep it simple** and use just *one* resource that can take you from zero to hireable, I suggest the free [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths). If you want more variety and more depth on certain topics, keep reading!
- **Why did I chose Ruby?** At first I went for full-stack JavaScript, but the JS ecosystem was confusing to me as a beginner. So I tried some others, and found Ruby to be the most enjoyable.
- **Make sure your day job is conducive to part-time studying** if you're a working adult looking to switch careers. I used to be a teacher and spent hours grading in the evenings and on weekends, which would have made studying very difficult. So I switched to a remote customer support job to free up my schedule.
- **You should spend more time *coding* than *reading about* coding**. I mention this because below I list lots of books and courses but not many hands-on projects. Why? Because starting a project and getting into a coding routine is easy, whereas knowing what to read/study is not obvious at first. Hence the focus on books and courses here.
- **Take care of yourself!** Exercise and get plenty of sleep, and you'll better retain what you learn. If you develop wrist pain from heavy computer use, act swiftly: get an ergonomic keyboard ([the one I use](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/keyboardio-atreus) has a learning curve, but I love it *and* it was affordable), [do daily wrist stretches](https://youtube.com/watch?v=fdD7CgN5FGg), and try a break app such as [Workrave](https://workrave.org/).

Without further ado, here is my learning road map. Resources marked with a dollar sign (ðŸ’²) cost money. You may be able to find books for free (from your local library, interlibrary loan, or more dubious sources) but buy them if/when you can, to support the authors.

## Basics

### Front-end basics

- [ ] Learn some HTML, CSS, and JS: [The Odin Project - Foundations path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) or resources under ["Front end"](#front-end) below.
- [ ] Build a blog from scratch. [Here's the first iteration of my blog](https://fpsvogel-2020.netlify.app), and [here's how I built it](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2020/zs). Building a blog is not only a good exercise in itself, but it might also give you extra motivation to write about what you learn.

### Ruby basics

- **Basics:**
  - [ ] [The Odin Project - Ruby](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby) <!-- https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4441966?s=280 -->
  - [ ] [GoRails - Ruby for Beginners](https://gorails.com/series/ruby-for-beginners) if you prefer videos. <!-- https://d2i2nj5el4wq1j.cloudfront.net/assets/logo-square-4991bf3ca2f693e197dea82ce6d287f10cfbc229f7ac3ad19d1619f030b77266.png -->
  - [ ] [Try Ruby](https://try.ruby-lang.org/) and [BigBinary Academy](https://academy.bigbinary.com/learn-ruby) if you prefer an interactive approach.
- **Guided practice:**
  - [ ] [Exercism - Ruby](https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby). Be sure to take notes each time you learn something new in an exercise, and at the end you could write up your reflections ([here are mine](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2020/exercism-ruby)).
- **OOP (object-oriented programming):**
  - [ ] ðŸ’²[Sandi Metz - Practical Object-Oriented Design](https://www.poodr.com)
  - [ ] ðŸ’²[Sandi Metz & Katrina Owen - 99 Bottles of OOP](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles-sample-ruby)
- **Build stuff with Ruby.** Here are some ideas:
  - A CLI (command-line interface) app. I made [one that gives statistics on a reading log](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/my-first-ruby-app-lessons-learned).
  - A game. See the [Games in Ruby](#games-in-ruby) section.
  - A static site. [Bridgetown](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown) is great for (among other things) building static sites, which are simpler than SSR (server-side rendered) sites Ã  la Rails. Maybe [rebuild your blog](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/build-a-blog-with-bridgetown)? Be sure to [join the Bridgetown Discord server](https://discord.gg/Cugms94QFM)â€”the maintainers are very welcoming and helpful to newbies.
  - More ideas: [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi), [Build your own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x), [Projectbook](https://projectbook.code.brettchalupa.com), [Project-based learning](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning#ruby)
- **Reference:**
  - [ ] [Ruby API](https://rubyapi.org). Mentioning it up here because it's the best Ruby docs site but very little-known. Since its search uses a query param, you can add a search keyword to your browser to let you quickly search from the address bar, for example "rb partition" would take you to https://rubyapi.org/3.2/o/s?q=partition

### Rails basics

Only books and courses are listed below, but be sure to *build things* as you learn. I myself [started building a large-ish Rails app](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/first-rails-app-plain-reading) at first, but then I found it more helpful to build a series of small throwaway apps ([1](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/gpt3-ai-story-writer), [2](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/wikipedia-explorer-discover-articles-like-stumbleupon), [3](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/pass-the-story-collaborative-writing-game), [4](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2022/doctor-lookup-health-provider-search-tool)).

### Getting hired

- **Get real-world experience to put on your resume:**
  - Contribute to open source projects. I've written [a short guide on how to get started](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-ruby-rails).
  - [The Agency of Learning](https://agencyoflearning.com/). They aren't always accepting applications, so you may need to check back.
  - [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). You'll need to dedicate 6 or 12 weeks to this one.
- **The job search:**

## Rails codebases to study

I've chosen the codebases below based on a these criteria:

* Is active, with recent commits.
* Does not use a JS framework on the front end, though I made exceptions.
* Is well-known *or* it solves a problem that's interesting to me.

If you want to explore more widely, here are other places to find open-source Ruby projects:

* [OpenSourceRails](https://opensourcerails.org/)
* [Ruby projects on CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/?language=Ruby), though not all of them are Rails apps
